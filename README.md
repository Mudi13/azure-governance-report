# Azure Cloud Governance and Monitoring System

This project demonstrates a simulated implementation of **cloud governance and monitoring** in **Microsoft Azure**, covering key governance areas such as cost monitoring, identity and access management (IAM), resource policies, monitoring, security, and backup best practices.  
Each module contains **step-by-step tasks**, **screenshots**, and a detailed `report.md` file (or PDF in the case of Module 7).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn and practice Azure governance concepts such as cost monitoring, access control, tagging policies, monitoring alerts, security posture, and backup protection.
By bringing these tasks together in a single report, the project demonstrates how different Azure services work together to build a foundation for cloud governance and monitoring.
